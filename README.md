# 🚗 Hill Climb Physics

A **2D physics-based car driving game** inspired by *Hill Climb Racing*.  
Navigate through challenging hilly terrain while managing fuel and maintaining balance.

## ✨ Features

- ⚙️ **Realistic Physics** — Gravity, collision detection, momentum, and terrain interaction  
- 🌄 **Dynamic Terrain** — Procedurally generated hills and valleys  
- ⛽ **Fuel Management** — Limited fuel adds a strategic challenge  
- 🎮 **Responsive Controls** — Smooth acceleration and braking  
- 📏 **Distance Tracking** — Compete for the longest distance  
- 🧩 **Visual Feedback** — Animated wheels, car tilting, and terrain rendering

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Open **`index.html`** in your web browser  
2. Use **Arrow Keys** to control the car:
   - → **Right Arrow** — Accelerate forward  
   - ← **Left Arrow** — Brake / Reverse  
3. Navigate through the hilly terrain  
4. Monitor your fuel level — when it runs out, the game ends  
5. Try to travel as far as possible without crashing 🚧

## ⚡ Game Mechanics

- 🪂 **Physics:** The car responds to gravity, friction, and collisions  
- 🏔️ **Terrain:** Each playthrough features procedurally generated terrain  
- ⛽ **Fuel Consumption:** Acceleration consumes fuel; braking does not  
- 🔩 **Collision System:** Wheels interact dynamically with the terrain  
- 🎥 **Camera:** Smoothly follows the car across the map

## 🧠 Technical Details

- Built using **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering  
- Pure **JavaScript physics engine** (no external libraries)  
- Fully **responsive** for various screen sizes  
- Runs **locally** — no installation or dependencies required
