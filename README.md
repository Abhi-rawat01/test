# Hill Climb Physics

A 2D physics-based car driving game inspired by Hill Climb Racing. Navigate through challenging hilly terrain while managing fuel and maintaining balance.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity, collision detection, momentum, and terrain interaction
- **Dynamic Terrain**: Procedurally generated hills and valleys
- **Fuel Management**: Limited fuel adds strategic challenge
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth acceleration and braking
- **Distance Tracking**: Compete for the longest distance
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated wheels, car tilting, and terrain rendering

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use **Arrow Keys** to control the car:
   - **Right Arrow (→)**: Accelerate forward
   - **Left Arrow (←)**: Brake/Reverse
3. Navigate through the hilly terrain
4. Monitor your fuel level - when it runs out, the game ends
5. Try to travel as far as possible without crashing

## Game Mechanics

- **Physics**: The car responds to gravity, friction, and collision forces
- **Terrain**: Each playthrough features uniquely generated terrain
- **Fuel Consumption**: Acceleration uses fuel; braking does not
- **Collision**: Wheels interact with terrain for realistic movement
- **Camera**: Follows the car as it progresses through the level

## Technical Details

- Built with HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Pure JavaScript physics engine
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- No external dependencies required

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or build process required.

Enjoy the ride! 🚗
